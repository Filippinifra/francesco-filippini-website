## Welcome!

This project is the repo about my personal website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Best feature

You can easily edit this project.
Check src -> constants folder, in each file there are some values.
You can change these values in order to change EVERY color of page's elements, animation life time etc

## Structure Folder

```python
src
├── components # All components (piece of reusable code)
├── constants # Editable constants to change colors, content etc
├── file # Files PDF format
├── img # Images in svg and png format
└── utils # Tools and utilities
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run nodemon`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
